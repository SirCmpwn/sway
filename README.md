# swea
swea is place where PRs from sway would be merged if it's not conflict with upstream sway.

plan to have swea-git and stable releases.

prefer to have PRs in sway first to make sure PRs compatible with upstream sway. Then create issue for merging.

ask for support in upstream sway about issues in this repo is not recommended.
