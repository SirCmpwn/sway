## Installation

### From Packages

Sway is not supported by many distributions yet. Here's a list of packages
available for you to install:

* [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?q=sway)
* [Gentoo](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/dev-libs/sway)
* [openSUSE Tumbleweed](https://software.opensuse.org/package/sway)

For other distros, [see this wiki page](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/sway/wiki/Install-on-other-distros).
If you're interested in packaging Sway for your distribution, stop by the IRC
channel or shoot an email to sir@cmpwn.com for advice.

### Compiling from Source

Install dependencies:

* cmake
* [wlc](https://github.com/Cloudef/wlc)
* wayland
* xwayland
* asciidoc
* pcre
* json-c
* pango
* cairo
* gdk-pixbuf2 *
* pam **
* imagemagick (required for image capture with swaygrab)
* ffmpeg (required for video capture with swaygrab)

_\*Only required for swaybar, swaybg, and swaylock_

_\*\*Only required for swaylock_

Run these commands:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_SYSCONFDIR=/etc ..
    make
    sudo make install

On systems without logind, you need to suid the sway binary:

    sudo chmod a+s /usr/local/bin/sway

## Tests

Run `make && make check` from the build directory to run tests. The exit code
will be the number of failed tests (0 for success).

## Configuration

If you already use i3, then copy your i3 config to `~/.config/sway/config` and
it'll work out of the box. Otherwise, copy the sample configuration file to
`~/.config/sway/config`. It is usually located at `/etc/sway/config`.
Run `man 5 sway` for information on the configuration.

My own dotfiles are available [here](https://gogs.sr.ht/SirCmpwn/dotfiles) if
you want some inspiration, and definitely check out the
[wiki](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/sway/wiki) as well.

## Running

Instead of running `startx`, run `sway`. You can run `sway` from within X as
well, which is useful for testing.
