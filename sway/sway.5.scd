sway(5)

# NAME

sway - configuration file and commands

# DESCRIPTION

A sway configuration file is a list of sway commands that are executed by sway
on startup.  These commands usually consist of setting your preferences and
setting key bindings. An example config is likely present in /etc/sway/config
for you to check out.

Lines in the configuration file might be extended through multiple lines by
adding a '\\' character at the end of line. e.g.:

```
bindsym Shift+XF86AudioRaiseVolume exec \\
	pactl set-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ -1%
```

These commands can be executed in your config file, via *swaymsg*(1), or via
the bindsym command.

# COMMAND CONVENTIONS

Commands are split into several arguments using spaces. You can enclose
arguments with quotation marks (*"..."* or *'...'*) to add spaces to a single
argument. You may also run several commands in order by separating each with
*,* or *;*.

Throughout the documentation, *|* is used to distinguish between arguments for
which you may only select one. *[...]* is used for optional arguments, and
*<...>* for arguments where you are expected to supply some value.

# COMMANDS

The following commands may only be used in the configuration file.

*bar {* <commands...> *}*
	_commands..._ after *{* will be interpreted as bar commands. For
	details, see *sway-bar*(5). A newline is required between *{* and the
	first command, and *}* must be alone on a line.

*default\_orientation* horizontal|vertical|auto
	Sets the default container layout for tiled containers.

*include* <path>
	Includes another file from _path_. _path_ can be either a full path or a
	path relative to the parent config, and expands shell syntax (see
	*wordexp*(3) for details). The same include file can only be included once;
	subsequent attempts will be ignored.

*set* <name> <value>
	Sets variable $_name_ to _value_. You can use the new variable in the
	arguments of future commands.

*swaybg\_command* <command>
	Executes custom background _command_. Default is _swaybg_. Refer to
	*output* below for more information.

The following commands cannot be used directly in the configuration file.
They are expected to be used with *bindsym* or at runtime through *swaymsg*(1).

*border* normal|pixel [<n>]
	Set border style for focused window. _normal_ includes a border of
	thickness _n_ and a title bar. _pixel_ is a border without title bar _n_
	pixels thick. Default is _normal_ with border thickness 2.

*border* none|toggle
	Set border style for focused window to _none_ or _toggle_ between the
	available border styles: _normal_, _pixel_, _none_.

*exit*
	Exit sway and end your Wayland session.

*floating* enable|disable|toggle
	Make focused view floating, non-floating, or the opposite of what it is now.

*focus* up|right|down|left
	Moves focus to the next container in the specified direction.

*focus* child
	Moves focus to the last-focused child of the focused container.

*focus* parent
	Moves focus to the parent of the focused container.

*focus* output up|right|down|left
	Moves focus to the next output in the specified direction.

*focus* output <name>
	Moves focus to the named output.

*focus* mode\_toggle
	Moves focus between the floating and tiled layers.

*fullscreen*
	Toggles fullscreen for the focused view.

*layout* splith|splitv|stacking|tabbed
	Sets the layout mode of the focused container.

*layout* toggle split
	Switches the focused container between the splitv and splith layouts.

*move* left|right|up|down [<px>]
	Moves the focused container in the direction specified. If the container,
	the optional _px_ argument specifies how many pixels to move the container.
	If unspecified, the default is 10 pixels. Pixels are ignored when moving
	tiled containers.

*move* container|window to workspace <name>
	Moves the focused container to the specified workspace.

*move* container|window to workspace prev|next
	Moves the focused container to the previous or next workspace on this
	output, or if no workspaces remain, the previous or next output.

*move* container|window to workspace prev\_on\_output|next\_on\_output
	Moves the focused container to the previous or next workspace on this
	output, wrapping around if already at the first or last workspace.

*move* container|window|workspace to output <name>
	Moves the focused container or workspace to the specified output.

*move* container|window|workspace to output up|right|down|left
	Moves the focused container or workspace to next output in the specified
	direction.

*move* [to] scratchpad
	Moves the focused window to the scratchpad.

*reload*
	Reloads the sway config file and applies any changes.

*resize* shrink|grow width|height [<amount>] [px|ppt]
	Resizes the currently focused container by _amount_, specified in pixels or
	percentage points. If omitted, floating containers are resized in px and
	tiled containers by ppt. If omitted, the default _amount_ is 10.

*resize set* <width> [px] <height> [px]
	Sets the width and height of the currently focused container to _width_
	pixels and _height_ pixels. The [px] parameters are optional and have no
	effect. This command only accepts a size in pixels. Width and height may be
	specified in either order.

*scratchpad show*
	Shows a window from the scratchpad. Repeatedly using this command will
	cycle through the windows in the scratchpad.

*split* vertical|v|horizontal|h|toggle|t
	Splits the current container, vertically or horizontally. When _toggle_ is
	specified, the current container is split opposite to the parent
	container's layout.

*splith*
	Equivalent to *split horizontal*

*splitv*
	Equivalent to *split vertical*

*splitt*
	Equivalent to *split toggle*

*sticky* enable|disable|toggle
	"Sticks" a floating window to the current output so that it shows up on all
	workspaces.

The following commands may be used either in the configuration file or at
runtime.

*assign* <criteria> [→] <workspace>
	Assigns views matching _criteria_ (see *CRITERIA* for details) to
	_workspace_. The → (U+2192) is optional and cosmetic. This command is
	equivalent to:
	
		for\_window <criteria> move container to workspace <workspace>

*bindsym* <key combo> <command>
	Binds _key combo_ to execute the sway command _command_ when pressed. You
	may use XKB key names here (*xev*(1) is a good tool for discovering these).

	Example:

		# Execute firefox when alt, shift, and f are pressed together
		bindsym Mod1+Shift+f exec firefox

	*bindcode* <code> <command> is also available for binding with key codes
	instead of key names.

*client.<class>* <border> <background> <text> <indicator> <child\_border>
	Configures the color of window borders and title bars. All 5 colors are
	required, with the exception of *client.background*, which requires exactly
	one. Colors may be specified in hex, either as _#RRGGBB_ or _#RRGGBBAA_.

	The available classes are:

	*client.background*
		Ignored (present for i3 compatibility).

	*client.focused*
		The window that has focus.

	*client.focused\_inactive*
		The most recently focused view within a container which is not focused.

	*client.placeholder*
		Ignored (present for i3 compatibility).

	*client.unfocused*
		A view that does not have focus.

	*client.urgent*
		A view with an urgency hint. *Note*: This is not currently implemented.

	The meaning of each color is:

	_border_
		The border around the title bar.

	_background_
		The background of the title bar.

	_text_
		The text color of the title bar.

	_indicator_
		The color used to indicate where a new view will open. In a tiled
		container, this would paint the right border of the current view if a
		new view would be opened to the right.

	_child\_border_
		The border around the view itself.

The default colors are:

	Enables, disables or toggles debug logging. _toggle_ cannot be used in the
	configuration file.

*default\_border* normal|none|pixel [<n>]
	Set default border style for new tiled windows.

*default\_floating\_border* normal|none|pixel [<n>]
	Set default border style for new floating windows. This only applies to
	windows that are spawned in floating mode, not windows that become floating
	afterwards.

*exec* <shell command>
	Executes _shell command_ with sh.

*exec\_always* <shell command>
	Like *exec*, but the shell command will be executed _again_ after *reload*.

*floating\_maximum\_size* <width> x <height>
	Specifies the maximum size of floating windows. -1 x -1 removes the upper
	limit.

*floating\_minimum\_size* <width> x <height>
	Specifies the minimum size of floating windows. The default is 75 x 50.

*floating\_modifier* <modifier> [normal|inverse]
	When the _modifier_ key is held down, you may hold left click to move
	windows, and right click to resize them. If _inverse_ is specified, left
	click is used for resizing and right click for moving.

*floating\_scroll* up|right|down|left [command]
	Sets a command to be executed when the mouse wheel is scrolled in the
	specified direction while holding the floating modifier. Resets the
	command, when given no arguments.

*focus\_follows\_mouse* yes|no
	If set to _yes_, moving your mouse over a window will focus that window.

*font* <font>
	Sets font for use in title bars in Pango format.

*for\_window* <criteria> <command>
	Whenever a window that matches _criteria_ appears, run list of commands.
	See *CRITERIA* for more details.

*gaps* edge\_gaps on|off|toggle
	When _on_, gaps will be added between windows and workspace edges if the
	inner gap is nonzero. When _off_, gaps will only be added between views.
	_toggle_ cannot be used in the configuration file.

*gaps* <amount>
	Sets _amount_ pixels of gap between windows and around each workspace.

*gaps* inner|outer <amount>
	Sets default _amount_ pixels of _inner_ or _outer_ gap, where the former
	affects spacing between views and the latter affects the space around each
	workspace.

*gaps* inner|outer all|workspace|current set|plus|minus <amount>
	Changes the gaps for the _inner_ or _outer_ gap. _all_ changes the gaps for
	all views or workspace, _workspace_ changes gaps for all views in current
	workspace (or current workspace), and _current_ changes gaps for the current
	view or workspace.

*hide\_edge\_borders* none|vertical|horizontal|both|smart
	Hides window borders adjacent to the screen edges. Default is _none_.

*input* <input\_device> *{* <commands...> *}*
	_commands..._ after *{* will be interpreted as input commands applying to
	the specified input device. For details, see *sway-input*(5). A newline is
	required between *{* and the first command, and *}* must be alone on a
	line.

	\* may be used in lieu of a specific device name to configure all input
	devices. A list of input device names may be obtained via *swaymsg -t
	get\_inputs*.

*seat* <seat> *{* <commands...> *}*
	_commands..._ after *{* will be interpreted as seat commands applying to
	the specified seat. For details, see *sway-input*(5). A newline is required
	between *{* and the first command, and *}* must be alone on a line.

*seat* <seat> cursor move|set <x> <y>
	Move specified seat's cursor relative to current position or wrap to
	absolute coordinates (with respect to the global coordinate space).
	Specifying either value as 0 will not update that coordinate.

*seat* <seat> cursor press|release left|right|1|2|3...
	Simulate pressing (or releasing) the specified mouse button on the
	specified seat.

*kill*
	Kills (closes) the currently focused container and all of its children.

*smart\_gaps* on|off
	If smart\_gaps are _on_ gaps will only be enabled if a workspace has more
	than one child.

*mark* --add|--replace [--toggle] <identifier>
	Marks are arbitrary labels that can be used to identify certain windows and
	then jump to them at a later time. By default, *mark* sets _identifier_ as
	the only mark on a window. _--add_ will instead add _identifier_ to the
	list of current marks. If _--toggle_ is specified mark will remove
	_identifier_ if it is already marked.

*mode* <mode>
	Switches to the specified mode. The default mode _default_.

*mode* <mode> *{* <commands...> *}*
	_commands..._ after *{* will be added to the specified mode. A newline is
	required between *{* and the first command, and *}* must be alone on a
	line. Only *bindsym* and *bindcode* commands are permitted in mode blocks.

*mouse\_warping* output|none
	If _output_ is specified, the mouse will be moved to new outputs as you
	move focus between them. Default is _output_.

*no\_focus* <criteria>
	Prevents windows matching <criteria> from being focused automatically when
	they're created. This has no effect on the first window in a workspace.

*output* <name> mode|resolution|res <WIDTHxHEIGHT>[@<RATE>[Hz]]
	Configures the specified output to use the given mode. Modes are a
	combination of width and height (in pixels) and a refresh rate that your
	display can be configured to use. For a list of available modes for each
	output, use *swaymsg -t get\_outputs*.

	Examples:

		output HDMI-A-1 mode 1920x1080

		output HDMI-A-1 mode 1920x1080@60Hz

*output* <name> position|pos <X,Y>
	Places the specified output at the specific position in the global
	coordinate space.

*output* <name> scale <factor>
	Scales the specified output by the specified scale _factor_. An integer is
	recommended, but fractional values are also supported. If a fractional
	value are specified, be warned that it is not possible to faithfully
	represent the contents of your windows - they will be rendered at the next
	highest integral scale factor and downscaled. You may be better served by
	setting an integral scale factor and adjusting the font size of your
	applications to taste.

*output* <name> background|bg <file> <mode>
	Sets the wallpaper for the given output to the specified file, using the
	given scaling mode (one of "stretch", "fill", "fit", "center", "tile").

**output** <name> background|bg <color> solid\_color
	Sets the background of the given output to the specified color. _color_
	should be specified as _#RRGGBB_. Alpha is not supported.

**output** <name> transform <transform>
	Sets the background transform to the given value. Can be one of "90", "180",
	"270" for rotation; or "flipped", "flipped-90", "flipped-180", "flipped-270"
	to apply a rotation and flip, or "normal" to apply no transform.

*output* <name> disable|enable
	Enables or disables the specified output (all outputs are enabled by
	default).

*NOTES FOR THE OUTPUT COMMANDS*

You may combine output commands into one, like so:

	output HDMI-A-1 mode 1920x1080 pos 1920,0 bg ~/wallpaper.png stretch

You can get a list of output names with *swaymsg -t get\_outputs*. You may also
match any output by using the output name "\*". Be sure to add this output
config after the others, or it will be matched instead of the others.

*show\_marks* on|off
	If *show\_marks* is on, marks will be displayed in the window borders.
	Any mark that starts with an underscore will not be drawn even if the
	option is on. The default is _on_.

*opacity* <value>
	Set the opacity of the window between 0 (completely transparent) and 1
	(completely opaque).

*unmark* [<identifier>]
	*unmark* will remove _identifier_ from the list of current marks on a
	window. If _identifier_ is omitted, all marks are removed.

*workspace* [number] <name>
	Switches to the specified workspace. The string "number" is optional and is
	used to sort workspaces.

*workspace* prev|next
	Switches to the next workspace on the current output or on the next output
	if currently on the last workspace.

*workspace* prev\_on\_output|next\_on\_output
	Switches to the next workspace on the current output.

*workspace* <name> output <output>
	Specifies that workspace _name_ should be shown on the specified _output_.

*workspace\_auto\_back\_and\_forth* yes|no
	When _yes_, repeating a workspace switch command will switch back to the
	prior workspace. For example, if you are currently on workspace 1,
	switch to workspace 2, then invoke the "workspace 2" command again, you
	will be returned to workspace 1. Default is _no_.

*workspace\_layout* default|stacking|tabbed
	Specifies the initial layout for new workspaces.

# CRITERIA

A criteria is a string in the form of, for example:

```
[class="[Rr]egex.*" title="some title"]
```

The string contains one or more (space separated) attribute/value pairs. They
are used by some commands to choose which views to execute actions on. All
attributes must match for the criteria to match.

Criteria may be used with either the *for\_window* or *assign* commands to
specify operations to perform on new views. A criteria may also be used to
perform specific commands (ones that normally act upon one window) on all views
that match that criteria. For example:

Focus on a window with the mark "IRC":

```
[con_mark="IRC"] focus
```

Kill all windows with the title "Emacs":

```
[class="Emacs"] kill
```

Mark all Firefox windows with "Browser":

```
[class="Firefox"] mark Browser
```

The following attributes may be matched with:

*app\_id*
	Compare value against the app id. Can be a regular expression. If value is
	\_\_focused\_\_, then the app id must be the same as that of the currently
	focused window.

*class*
	Compare value against the window class. Can be a regular expression. If
	value is \_\_focused\_\_, then the window class must be the same as that of
	the currently focused window.

*con\_id*
	Compare against the internal container ID, which you can find via IPC.

*con\_mark*
	Compare against the window marks. Can be a regular expression.

*floating*
	Matches floating windows.

*id*
	Compare value against the X11 window ID. Must be numeric.

*instance*
	Compare value against the window instance. Can be a regular expression. If
	value is \_\_focused\_\_, then the window instance must be the same as that
	of the currently focused window.

*tiling*
	Matches tiling windows.

*title*
	Compare against the window title. Can be a regular expression. If value is
	\_\_focused\_\_, then the window title must be the same as that of the
	currently focused window.

*urgent*
	Compares the urgent state of the window. Can be "latest" or "oldest".

*window\_role*
	Compare against the window role (WM\_WINDOW\_ROLE). Can be a regular
	expression. If value is \_\_focused\_\_, then the window role must be the
	same as that of the currently focused window.

*window\_type*
	Compare against the window type (\_NET\_WM\_WINDOW\_TYPE). Possible values
	are normal, dialog, utility, toolbar, splash, menu, dropdown\_menu,
	popup\_menu, tooltip and notification.

*workspace*
	Compare against the workspace name for this view. Can be a regular
	expression. If the value is \_\_focused\_\_, then all the views on the
	currently focused workspace matches.
